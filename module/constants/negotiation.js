            description: `An NPC with the benevolence motivation believes in sharing what they have with others. For NPCs in a negotiation, their
            charity is limited (otherwise they’re likely to just give the heroes what they need). It may only extend to a specific group of
            people. A benevolent pirate captain might share their plunder freely with the rest of their crew, but they’re still
            plundering! It could be that the NPC’s charity is limited by the fact that they don’t have much to give. A benevolent NPC
            might be hesitant to give the heroes help because they believe their limited resources are more necessary or could do
            more good somewhere else.
            Arguments that appeal to a benevolence motivation contend that if the NPC strikes a deal with the heroes, the people the
            NPC cares about will benefit from the deal. “If you lend us the Sword of Agathor, we will actually make Capital safer for
            your guild by using it to lay low your enemies.” “If you can teleport us into the dragon’s cave, we’ll give you half the wyrm’s
            hoard once we cut off the creature’s head. That could benefit generations of students at your academy!”

            description: `An NPC with the discovery motivation wants to learn new lore, explore forgotten places, break ground with new
            experiments, or uncover artifacts buried in time. Their curiosity and quest for knowledge might be driven by a specific
            goal, such as seeking the cure for a rare disease or a portal to a specific, far-off world, or it could be that they are a
            naturally inquisitive person who just wants to understand all they can about the timescape.
            Arguments that appeal to a discovery motivation contend that striking a deal with the heroes will allow the NPC to gain
            new knowledge or acquire unique property. “Allow us to use your cipher to translate the only copy of the Codex Mortis, and
            then we’ll let you read the book when we’re done.” “We know the journey to Decant Isle is dangerous, but we’re going into
            uncharted territory. We thought that your crew of sailors might want to be among humans to lay eyes on the place.”
